##Intro to React by an example of live car filtering page

Here I have built a live car filtering page using React.js. You can check the result page here and the source code here. In the following paragraph, I will give you some brief understanding of React and how to get started with a simple web page just like live filtering.


###Why React?
Working as a front-end developer, have you got tired of writing hundreds or thousands js code to make interactive UI elements? Or have you felt it troublesome to deal with data changes?

###What is React?
React is an open-source JavaScript library maintained by Facebook. It is declarative, flexible and component-based. Each component has its own states and props, and data is passed through props.
